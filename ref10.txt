# 10 Ponder : Status Report

1. What features were completed in your project this week?
This week, some improved state management was introduced which polished the UI quite a bit. We also finished up some of the basic stat/reporting
features that are part of our MVP features. We're also working to finish up the ability to create logs for a vehicle.

2. What bugs were fixed in your project this week?
No official bugs were worked on this week. At this point our main focus is feature work so there are not many bugs that are a priority yet.

3. Did anyone on your team have an infraction this week?
This week Lief was unable to attend the team meeting as well as complete some of the work commitments for the week.

4. If someone did have an infraction, was the penalty paid?
At this point, no. We're looking to have another meeting sometime between the end of this week and the next planned
meeting where this can be addressed.

5. How many hours did you spend on your team project this week?
8 hours

6. Are there any issues related to your team or project you want to tell your instructor about?
Overall the application is moving forward alright. However, as we get closer and closer to the end of the class,
I've noticed that general team communication is becoming more and more difficult...
