# 08 Ponder : Weekly Reflection

1. What is the purpose of a unit test?
To test the functionality of a piece of the code and to prevent regressions in functionality.


2. What are the pros and cons of Test Driven Development?
pro: well defined acceptance criteria
con: can be a hurdle to hop before actual feature development


3. How are assert statements used by JUnit for unit testing?
They are used to assert a truth. So you can use them to check the value of a function is what you'd expect it to be.


4. A common design-pattern interview question is "Describe a situation where you would use the Observer pattern.". How would you answer that question?
I would use the observer pattern anytime I want a class to respond to changes in the data in the
observable class. So if you want a view to change according to state you could "subscribe" to is as an observer.


5. Of all of the resources and tutorials in this week's assignments, which was the _most_ helpful to you and why?
https://developer.android.com/training/testing/unit-testing/local-unit-tests.html
Because it actually got the tests working.


6. Of all of the resources and tutorials in this week's assignments, which was the _least_ helpful to you and why?
https://www.codeproject.com/Articles/1474/Events-and-event-handling-in-C because I likely won't use it much.

7. How would you say your team project is proceeding so far?
So far so good. We have a couple key pieces of functionality put together.


8. Did anyone on your team have any violations/infractions of the Team Agreement this week? If so, were the punishments enforced?
No infractions.


9. Are there any concerns regarding your project or your team that you want the teacher to know about?
None yet.
