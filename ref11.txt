# 11 Ponder : Status Report

1. What features were completed in your project this week?
This week we focused mostly on some minor improvements (things like more polished adapters) as well as
creating logs. The key pieces!


2. What bugs were fixed in your project this week?
We didn't quite get our bugs fixed yet. I'm looking into why some event handlers aren't firing, even
though they are all set up the same and the editor.


3. Did anyone on your team have an infraction this week?
Well, we haven't heard from 50% of our group in a while, so I've kind of moved on from the whole
"infraction" system...


4. If someone did have an infraction, was the penalty paid?
No.


5. How many hours did you spend on your team project this week?
3

6. Are there any issues related to your team or project you want to tell your instructor about?
